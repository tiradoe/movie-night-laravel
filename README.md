# Movie Night

## Requirements

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

- On Windows and Mac choose "Docker Desktop".
- On Linux just use your distro's
package manager and laugh at the GUI using n00bs.

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

An API key from the [Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)

## Setup

Run the `firstRun.sh` bash script and follow the prompts.

This will probably take a while but when it's done, go to `http://localhost:8080`
to see the site. API docs can be found at `localhost/api/docs`
